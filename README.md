## Inspiration
We wanted to create a space where people could take some time to reflect about their day in a mindful way. 

## What it does
This cozy online diary assigns you a new prompt every day. You can answer the prompt with text or an image and save it. For every completed prompt, you receive a flower for your garden. Throughout the week you can look back at your old prompts. 

## How we built it
We designed on paper and then translated it into Figma. For the backend we used React, HTML, and CSS. We used Co-pilot for debugging, Git and Github for version control. Also, the power of friendship was very instrumental.

## Challenges we ran into
Setting up React was difficult. Most of us coming form a non-coding background, it was hard to learn new languages and softwares that weren't necessarily intuitive to our skillset. For example, learning to "save" the prompt response took a long time. Translating the design into code was also hard to navigate as it is time consuming. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Getting to talk to people/ mentors and learning from our team mates (breaking out of my shell). Finishing a project was also a goal that we came into the hackathon with and we were (mostly) able to complete. 

On the design end, I am proud of the work that went into the Figma prototype as well as the care that went into selecting and drawing the daily flower. 

## What we learned
The importance of supportive teammates and having an environment that makes it fun and safe to explore. We all learned a skill that we were previously uncomfortable with. Its all about trying something new and being afraid to fail (it is always alright, we are learners!). Also, how to be open and honest communicators!

## What's next for Mossy Memos
We want to be able to link Memos with other people so you can view your friends' Memos and gardens. We would also like to expand the amount of flowers and maybe create a page where you can learn about your flower of the day!
